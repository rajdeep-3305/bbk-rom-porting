# CRB Debloater

Handy for cleaning out unwanted apps/bloatware after image extraction.  

How to use:
1. Extract the images.
2. Run the debloater tool (search Telegram or XDA for the latest if link breaks).
3. Review the list, pick what you want to keep, and dump the rest.
4. Repackage—done!

If you get stuck, just ask in Issues—someone almost always has the tool or a tip.
